Project: RandNums (Random Food Suggestion/Simulation)

What: RandNums is designed to take several preferences based of each individuals account (budget, cuisine allowances, health restrictions, etc) and provide a suggestion of a randomized meal from a randomized restaurant that fit the criteria. 

Why the project is useful: RandNums will solve the everlasting question: "What am I going to eat?". It can either spark inspiration to help people decide what route to take with their breakfast/lunch/dinner plans, or it can spark business to restaurants that people do not normally visit. 

How users can get started with the project: RandNums is deployed on Heroku.

Where users can get help with your project: Help page is under development.

Who maintains and contributes to the project: Devan Bickham is the primary contributor. 



What the site currently does:

- Add user to local DB
	- Register User with validation
	- Log already existing user in with validation
	- Logs user out when desired

- Set user preferences (budget, cuisines)
	- Shows current selected preferences per user


What I plan on adding:

- Adding JQuery to request individual meal based of randomized parameters

- Adding photo to a users account

- Adding more UI (images, fonts, etc)

- Bonus: 
	- Previous 5 randomized meals for reference
	- Favorites
